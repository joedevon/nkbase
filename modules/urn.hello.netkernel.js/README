Since my previous example, urn.hello.xrl.templates, was missing a bit of functionality, I asked the kind folks at NetKernel for some help, with a twist. I said make the example work with Javascript :)

Obviously, Node is quite "hot" right now, so here's another way to use js on the server :) I'm going to unofficially dub it netkernel.js :)

PREREQUISITE:
Edit your hosts file, usually located in /etc/hosts but if not, look it up for your OS here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)#Location_in_the_file_system

Once you find it add this:

127.0.0.1	netkernel-js.com

When your code is in place you should be able to get your page showing at this url:
http://netkernel-js.com:8081

I'm still using the Skeleton css Framework:

Concept:
I put global templates in /resources/template/global.
Then the idea being that you'll have a homepage and a blog. They each need their own title injected into the header. So this is a proof of concept in mixing and matching templates like you'll need to do for many sites.
Obviously the homepage templates are in /resources/template/home and the blog at /resources/template/blog
