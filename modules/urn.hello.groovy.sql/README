Go to /path/to/urn.hello.groovy.sql/etc/ConfigRDBMS.xml and put your database credentials there.

Then to:
http://localhost:8080/hello_groovy_sql/

and you should get a list of tables in your 'test' database, which you MUST create first, generated in:

/path/to/modules/urn.hello.groovy.sql/resources/endpoints/sql.gy

*NOTE: I got my JDBC connector and stuck it in /etc/lib from here:
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
and you MUST do the same.
