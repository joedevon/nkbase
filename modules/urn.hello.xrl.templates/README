This module is a sample idea of how to set up xrl templates in a logical manner. The urn.hello.vhost example is a pre-requisite for understanding this one. Do NOT have both modules active at the same time. They will conflict. Don't forget to edit your etc/hosts file the same way...

You can test this module at http://hello-vhost.com:8081 and http://hello-vhost.com:8081/away

The goal here was to create two pages to this sample app. "Home" and "Away". I wanted to create a global header.xml and body.xml that would call the local title.xml depending if you landed on the "home" page or the "away" page....Unfortunately:

@TODO This doesn't completely work. The head.xml is calling title.xml, but it's hitting the "home" page's title.xml, instead of "away" page's title.xml...and failing. You can tell it fails because the TITLE of the page points to 'Home' instead of 'Away'. ;)

@TODO I'd like to move the dynamic call to xrl resources up to the module.xml so that I don't have to redefine it in the mapperConfig.xml each time. It probably isn't working because I need the right syntax to make it active:xrl.

P.S. Forgot to mention the stylesheets are based off of Skeleton, an HTML5 css framework I like. I had to remove a few things to get it to work with xrl.
