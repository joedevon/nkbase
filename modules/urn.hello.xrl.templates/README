This module is a sample idea of how to set up xrl templates in a logical manner. The urn.hello.vhost example is a pre-requisite for understanding this one. Do NOT have both modules active at the same time. They will conflict. Don't forget to edit your etc/hosts file the same way...

You can test this module at http://hello-vhost.com:8081

The goal here was to create to pages to this sample app. "Home". And "Away". I wanted to create a global header.xml and body.xml that would call the local title.xml depending if you landed on the "home" page or the "away" page....Unfortunately:

@TODO This doesn't completely work. The head.xml is calling title.xml, but it's hitting the "home" page's title.xml, instead of "away" page's title.xml...and failing.
